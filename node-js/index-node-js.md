## Introduction

Please, try to keep your contributions to code-snippets sticking to the following premises:

1. Commit only "working code".
2. Do NOT leave sensible details like environment files in the repo. Instead, provide templates and explanations on how to define them, using sample values.
3. Avoid leaving package-lock.json files and compiling artifacts along your repo. If you want to filter these in a simple manner, please incorporate to your base code-snippet folder a copy of the `.gitignore` file at the root of code-snippets to help you filtering out undersired commit candidates.
4. Try to provide some explanation of what your code does. Provide it in the form of a README.md file at the root level of your code-snippet.
5. when looking into contributions, check [contributing rules](CONTRIBUTING.md) to determine if there are already some specific rules in place.
6. Enjoy and come to the [discord channel](https://discord.gg/aBTHCcWsy2) if you want to share some ideas!
